       <h2>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM </h2>
       <br>
       <h3> Nicotine reaches your brain in mere seconds and makes you feel more energized for a while. But as that effect wears off, you feel tired and crave more. Nicotine is extremely habit-forming, which is why people find smoking so difficult to quit.</h3>
        <br>
       <h2>RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h2>
       <br>
       <h3> When you inhale smoke, you’re taking in substances that can damage your lungs. Along with increased infections, people who smoke are at higher risk for chronic nonreversible lung conditions such as:
        <br>
        •	emphysema, the destruction of the air sacs in your lungs
        <br>
        •	chronic bronchitis, permanent inflammation that affects the lining of the breathing tubes of the lungs
       <br>
        •	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a group of lung diseases
       <br>
        •	lung cancer
        <br>
        Children whose parents smoke are more prone to coughing, wheezing, and asthma attacks than children whose parents don’t. They also tend to have higher rates of pneumonia and bronchitis.</h3>
      <br>
        <h2>CARDIO VASCULAR SYSTEM</h2>
        <br> 
        <h3>Smoking damages your entire cardiovascular system. Nicotine causes blood vessels to tighten, which restricts the flow of blood. Over time, the ongoing narrowing, along with damage to the blood vessels, can cause peripheral artery disease.
        
        Smoking also raises blood pressure, weakens blood vessel walls, and increases blood clots. Together, this raises your risk of stroke.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM (skin, hair, and nails)</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>The more obvious signs of smoking involve skin changes. A recent study has shown that smoking dramatically increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (skin cancer). Smoking increases the likelihood of fungal nail infections. Nicotine increases hair loss, balding, and graying.</h3>
       <br>
        <h2>DIGESTIVE SYSTEM</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Smoking increases the risk of mouth, throat, larynx, and oesophagus cancer. Smokers also have higher rates of pancreatic cancer. Even people who “smoke but don’t inhale” face an increased risk of mouth cancer.
        Smoking puts you at increased risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications, which tend to develop at a faster rate than in people who don’t smoke.</h3>
